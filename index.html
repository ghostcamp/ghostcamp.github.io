                <p><span>The Charm of Poulsbo</span><br>Founded by Vikings marauding in long boats, Poulsbo has held close to its Norse seafaring roots. The charming downtown, nestled on the waters of the Puget Sound, features charming Norwegian storybook architecture with only a hint of kitsch. Diversions abound. Explore super adorbs bookstores, bakeries, and coffee shops. Then jump right into the frigid waters of Liberty Bay for a bracing open water swim! Or rent one of the abundant kayaks.</p>

                <p><span>An Outdoor Wonderland</span><br>Thwart existential crisis while strolling along the beach at Point No Point. Walk around the historic lighthouse which has been heralded as “North Kitsap County’s 8th best maritime navigational feature” for three of the last ten years. Ponder discouraging beach naming conventions at Foulweather Bluff. There you will encounter forest trails, sandy beach, marine wetlands, and tide pools, all while hardly breaking a sweat.</p>

                <p><span>Seattle</span><br>Just a short ferry ride away is the jewel of the PNW, yes Seattle. Once there your ticket to see the sights is aboard our finest acheivement: the monorail. As you are gliding along on one rail you’ll feel as if you aren’t only traveling through space, but also into the distant future! See the sights the way our decendents will, from a train car balanced on not two but one rail. Don’t miss Pike Place Market, The EMP, or any of the manifold museum and entertainment options.</p>

                <p class="padbottom"><span>Victoria</span><br>Don’t forget your passport, because you are about to become a citizen of the world! You will brave the Strait of Juan de Fuca aboard a stout ferry boat and arrive in the land of dreams: Victoria. There is apparently a huge rope footbridge to walk across like you’re Indiana Jones. I’ve also heard great things about Miniature World, where they have really small versions of things that are usually normal size.</p>
